Serenade
Our love is the serenade
A song the heavens made and angels played
When first we kissed
We touched and I became devine my love
Because of you the stars that shine my love
Their mine my love

Serenade
Our love is the serenade
A song of sweet desire
No ordinary choir could quite resist
I have known the magic of
A theme that cannot take
Our serenade of loveeeeeeeeee
